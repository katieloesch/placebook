## <a name="deliverables"></a> 5. Deliverables

### MVP

#### 1. Authentication & Authorization

- Secure sign-up and login with JWT-based authentication
- Password hashing
- Role-based access control to protect user-specific data and routes

#### 2. Full CRUD operations for places:

- Create new places with title, description, and address
- Upload an image associated with each place
- Edit or delete only the userâ€™s own places
- View all users and their shared places

#### 3. Frontend

- Responsive design with a clean, intuitive layout
- Context API for global state management
- Custom hooks for HTTP requests and form handling
- Real-time image preview during place creation
- Data validation for form inputs
- Interactive map display using Google Maps API to visualize location data

#### 4. Backend

- RESTful API with modular routing, structured error handling, and data validation
- Data validation and sanitization
- Data storage using MongoDB and hosting via MongoDB Atlas

#### 5. Deployment

- Independent deployment of frontend and backend

### Potential Extra Features / Stretch Goals

- File upload for user profile picture
- User profile page
- Dark mode toggle
- Pagination for places
- Refresh token and token renewal system
- Cloudinary or S3 for cloud image storage
- Optimize image sizes automatically on upload
- Unit and integration tests (e.g. Jest, React Testing Library, Supertest)

### User stories

#### Authentication & Access Control

- As a user, I should be able to sign up with my email and password, so that I can create an account and start sharing places.
- As a user, I should be able to log in securely, so that I can access and manage my content.
- As a user, I should be automatically logged out when my token expires, so that my account stays secure.
- As a user, I should only be able to access protected pages if Iâ€™m authenticated.

#### Place Management

- As a user, I should be able to add a new place with a title, description, address, and image, so that I can share locations Iâ€™ve visited.
- As a user, I should be able to see the address I entered on a map.
- As a user, I should be able to upload an image when creating a place.
- As a user, I should be able to preview my image before uploading it.
- As a user, I should be able to edit or delete a place, so that I can keep my content accurate and up to date.
- As a user, I should be able to view a list of all places shared by a specific user, so that I can see what others have shared.

### User Experience & Interface

- As a user, I should be able to use the app comfortably on any device.
- As a user, I should be able to see loading spinners during data fetches, so that I know the app is working.
- As a user, I should be able to see error messages and modals when something goes wrong, so that I understand whatâ€™s happening and how to fix it.

## <a name="challenges"></a> 7. Challenges

- Authorization Logic: Ensuring that only the original creator of a post could edit or delete their own content required careful implementation of role checks and user ID validation on both the client and server sides.
- CORS Configuration for Cross-Origin Requests: Allowing the frontend and backend to communicate across different domains required configuring CORS headers and handling preflight OPTIONS requests.
- Address Geocoding: Converting user-entered addresses into geo-coordinates for map display involved integrating a geocoding API, managing fallback behaviour, and gracefully handling errors or ambiguous results.
- Conditional Routing Based on Auth State: Dynamically rendering routes and navigation links based on the user's authentication status involved using React Context, route guards, and maintaining consistent state across components.
- File and Error Cleanup: Ensuring that uploaded files werenâ€™t left orphaned after failed requests or remained after their associated places were deleted required implementing cleanup logic both during error handling and on resource deletion.

## <a name="wins"></a> 8. Wins

- Implemented role-based access control and JWT-based authentication with hashed passwords using bcryptjs, ensuring secure user login and registration.
- Achieved full CRUD functionality and integrated the Google Maps API to convert user-provided addresses into geo-coordinates, rendering them on a dynamic map.
- Created custom React hooks to encapsulate HTTP request and form logic, resulting in cleaner and reusable code.
- Delivered a fully responsive user interface that works across both desktop and mobile devices.
- Successfully deployed the frontend and backend independently on separate platforms.

## <a name="takeaways"></a> 9. Key Learnings & Takeaways

- Managed to build a full-stack MERN application from scratch, understanding how frontend and backend systems interact.
- Learned how to implement secure authentication using JWTs and password hashing with bcryptjs, including route protection on both client and server sides.
- Gained experience bridging frontend UX with real-world data services by integrating the Google Maps API to dynamically convert addresses into coordinates and display them on an interactive map
- Developed custom React hooks to abstract logic for HTTP requests and form handling, reinforcing the value of modular, reusable code.
- Deepened my understanding of CORS, environment variables, and cross-origin cookie/session strategies by deploying and debugging a split-stack MERN app

## <a name="future-improvements"></a> 10. Future Improvements

- Testing Suite: Implement unit and integration tests using tools e.g. Jest, React Testing Library, Supertest
- Cloud Image Storage: Migrate image uploads to cloud-based solutions like Cloudinary or AWS S3
- Admin Dashboard: Develop an admin interface to view, manage, and moderate all user-generated content.
- Pagination: Introduce pagination for user and place listings to improve performance and user experience on data-heavy pages.
- Dark Mode: Introduce a dark mode toggle to accommodate user preferences.
- Accessibility Enhancements: Conduct accessibility audits and implement features such as keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and ARIA roles to ensure an inclusive user experience.
